I"o<p>Hi Mates!</p>

<p>I played this CTF as usually along with my team <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/217079">Invaders0x1</a>. During the competition, my team and I worked tirelessly without taking a break from Fri, 21 April 2023, 22:30 IST ‚Äî Sun, 23 April 2023, 22:30 IST.<br />
Proud to share our team ranked <a style="color: cyan;" href="https://ctftime.org/event/1974" target="_blank">#Top6</a> globally in <a>DawgCTF2023</a> which was hosted by <a style="color: cyan;" href="https://umbccd.umbc.edu/">UMBCCyberDawgs</a>.
We faced tough competition from some of the best teams in the world, but we were determined to succeed.
Despite the difficulty of the task, our team persevered and came up with a creative solution.</p>

<p>Overall, we are grateful for the experience and proud of our achievement. We will continue to work hard and strive for excellence in future competitions.<br />
Our team knows that <a>#persistence</a> is key to success, and we will continue to demonstrate that in everything we do.</p>

<p>Here are some of the challenges I have solved :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I got this radio recording of a local police department using my trusty scanner, can you figure out what all those fancy numbers mean?
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(The flag will be in alphabetical format only and you will enclose it in DawgCTF, i.e DawgCTF{FLAGGERT}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After downloading the <strong>40-second</strong> audio file, I have been listening to this audio for nearly <strong>1 hour</strong> in an attempt to understand and identify the number digits in the audio.<br />
However, I have not been successful in identifying the exact number digits. As a result, I decided to use online tools like <strong>Flixier</strong> to generate a transcript (i.e., convert audio to text), but it gave worse results than what I was able to do myself ü•≤.‚óè</p>

<p>Again I was decided to do myself. And the result is <br /></p>

<p><strong>Step-1: [10-1-8, 10-7, 10-0, 10-17, 10-15, 10-4, 10-0, 10-1-7, 10-18 And 65 ]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step-2: [10-18, 10-7, 10-0, 10-17, 10-15, 10-4, 10-0, 10-17, 10-18 And 65]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step-3: [18, 7, 0, 17, 15, 4, 0, 17, 18 And 65]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step-4: [18, 7, 0, 17, 15, 4, 0, 17, 18, A]</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Here 65 is the hint, i.e., 65 = A in ASCII
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After spending whole day with different ways to decode the sequence,</p>

<p>Finally figured something good.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>i.e., Add 65 to all numbers
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Step-5: [18+65 7+65 0+65 17+65 15+65 4+65 0+65 17+65 18+65]</strong>
<strong>Step-4: [83 72 65 82 80 69 65 82 83]</strong></p>
