H! , This is Mural!  aka M4R10 .
<br>
As a highly motivated student majoring in Computer Science and Technologies at <a style="color:cyan" href="https://rguktn.ac.in" target="_blank">Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge and Technologies-Nuzvid.</a> My passion for computer programming and cybersecurity is reflected in my work. I am a quick learner with a fun, outgoing personality and the ability to handle stressful situations with ease.
<br>
With a drive to explore new technologies and a deep interest in Cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and related fields, I continuously seek opportunities to grow my knowledge and skills. My ability to work effectively in teams and interact with people has been honed through various projects and extracurricular activities.
<br>    
My ultimate goal is to pursue a career in the cybersecurity field, and I firmly believe that my skills and passion for the industry will make me a valuable asset to any team. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to this constantly evolving field and making a positive impact.
Currently, I am working on automation projects in cybersecurity and actively participate in CTFs every week.
<a style="color:lightred;">I am open to new opportunities and look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals ^_^</a>
