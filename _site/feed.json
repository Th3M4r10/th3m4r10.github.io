The challenge also mentions that “online tools won’t work” in solving the cipher.Initially, the approach of translating the Chinese text to English and then using a substitution cipher decoder may seem like a viable solution. However, it turns out that my assumption was wrong🥲.Although translating the text did not confirm my assumption, I am confident that I can randomly assign English alphabets to the Chinese characters based on their respective patterns.

PicoCTF is a free online cybersecurity competition aimed at middle and high school students, but it’s also suitable for beginners of all ages. It was a great learning experience and I really learnt a lot.Let me explain the challenges that I have solved in picoCTF 2023.General Skills :I solved all the challenges that were given !ChronoHere is the given challenge :Firstly, We have to launch the instance and connect to the server with given credentials.Based on the question prompt it had to be cron jobs.After various attempts to access crontab itself, I tried looking inside /etc/crontab with the cat command.  Flag : picoCTF{Sch3DUL7NG_T45K3_L1NUX_1b4d8744}Money-wareHere is the given challenge :I don’t know what it is but i’m googling 1Mz7153HMuxXTuR2R1t78mGSdzaAtNbBWX, I got the link which had reports with descriptions and one of those descriptions points us to:More information is here :  https://blog.avira.com/petya-strikes-back/ This is an article about a vulnerability called Petya so our answer should be:  Flag : picoCTF{petya}PermissionsHere is the given challenge :We have to connect the server and cd / , I saw a directory named challenge, inside it there was a file which when cating it game the flag.  Flag : picoCTF{uS1ng_v1m_3dit0r_021d10ab}RepetitionsHere is the given challenge :The file itself looks like standard base64 encoding and decoding it will give you the flag use cyberchef.I had to decode with base64 six times to get the flag 😂  Flag : picoCTF{base64_n3st3d_dic0d!n8_d0wnl04d3d_dfe803c6}UselessHere is the given challenge :In the home directory there is a file named useless.After running the command man uselessWe got the flag,  Flag : picoCTF{us3l3ss_ch4ll3ng3_3xpl0it3d_3555}SpecialHere is the given challenge :This challenge was hard and to come with this bash script.My solution was as follows:cat flag.txt | cat /home/ctf-player/*/*.txt  Flag : picoCTF{5p311ch3ck_15_7h3_w0r57_a60bdf40}*** SpecialerHere is the given challenge :Connecting into the shell we’re not allowed a lot of things like cat, ls....After a lot of tries,My solution was as follows:echo \"$( &lt; /home/ctf-player/ala/kazam.txt)\"Now we got the flag :  Flag : picoCTF{5p311ch3ck_15_7h3_w0r57_a60bdf40}Cryptographhy :Although I couldn’t solve all the challenges, I managed to solve some of the challenges that I knew how to do!HideToSeeHere is the given challenge :Lets download the file.This is a jpeg file. We’ll be using a tool called steghide to extract information from this jpeg file, Use : steghide -sf --extract atbash.jpgHere we got a text file called encrypted.txt, Use : cat encrypted.txtkrxlXGU{zgyzhs_xizxp_8z0uvwwx}It looks like flag but it’s not.Now just need to decode atbash and you’re doneWe got the flag,  Flag : picoCTF{atbash_crack_6c4bcb08}ReadMyCertHere is the given challenge :Lets download the file.From the hint we were try to read the file. Bang !!And the flag is,  Flag : picoCTF{read_mycert_41d1c74c}RotationHere is the given challenge :Lets download the file and open with cat encrypted.txtxqkwKBN{z0bib1wv_l3kzgxb3l_555957n3}We got another encrypted text having the flag format.
