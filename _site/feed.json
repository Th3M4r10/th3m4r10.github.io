Which was happened from Fri, 25 Aug. 2023, 21:30 IST to Sun, 27 Aug. 2023, 21:30 IST.Here is the challenge from the category of Professional Programming &amp; Coding (PPC)Wiki GameWelcome to Project SEKAI Online Judge!Author: sahuang❖ Note :Time limit is 5 seconds. There is rate limiting and you can only submit once every 30 seconds. For simplicity, sample input 1.in is given in this challenge.Server:  http://algo-server.chals.sekai.teamFiles:  Wiki_Game.pdf   1.inProblem StatementThe Wiki Game is a hypertextual game designed to work speciﬁcally with Wikipedia. Player starts on some randomly selected article, and must navigate to another pre-selected target article solely by clicking links within each article. The goal is to arriveat the target article in the fewest clicks. According to Six degrees of Wikipedia, you can almost always complete the game in 6 clicks.The Wikipedia database can be modelled as an unweighted, directed graph where each article corresponds to a vertex. It is important to note that the graph can contain cycles. Your goal is to efﬁciently determine whether it is possible to navigate from the source article to the target article within a maximum path length of 6.InputThe ﬁrst line of input contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 20), the number of test cases. In each test case, the ﬁrst line contains two space-separated integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1,000) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 4,000),the number of vertices and edges respectively. The next m lines describe the graph. The ith line contains two space-separated integers ui, vi (0 ≤ ui ≠ vi&lt; n), meaning there exists a path from ui to vi . The last line contains two space-separated integers src, dst (0 ≤ src ≠ dst &lt; n), the source and target vertices.OutputOutput should have T lines. Each line prints YES if there exists a path from src to dst within a path length of 6, or NO otherwise. Remember to print them in upper-case.ExplanationIn the ﬁrst test case, there exists a path 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 of length 6, so the answer is YES.In the second test case, there is no path from 0 to 9 so the answer is NO. There is a path of length 3 from 9 to 0, but the graph is directed so it does not count.To meet the time limit of 5 seconds and optimize the solution further, I used a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find a path within a maximum of 6 steps. I thought BFS is a better choice for this scenario as it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we can find the shortest path first. Here’s the Python code using BFS:CODE:#!/usr/bin/env python3def is_possible_to_reach(graph, src, dst):    visited = [False] * len(graph)    queue = [(src, 0)]    while queue:        node, depth = queue.pop(0)        if node == dst:            return True        if depth &gt;= 6:            continue        visited[node] = True        for neighbor in graph[node]:            if not visited[neighbor]:                queue.append((neighbor, depth + 1))    return Falsedef main():    T = int(input())    for _ in range(T):        n, m = map(int, input().split())        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]        for _ in range(m):            u, v = map(int, input().split())            graph[u].append(v)        src, dst = map(int, input().split())        if is_possible_to_reach(graph, src, dst):            print(\"YES\")        else:            print(\"NO\")if __name__ == \"__main__\":    main()This code should provide a faster solution using BFS, which is well-suited for finding paths in graphs. It will also handle the given time limit and rate limiting constraints more effectively.Finally I got the flag,  Flag : SEKAI{hyp3rL1nk_cha115_4r3_EZ}",

            "content_text": "Hello, everyone!It has been a long time, but I am back again with an exciting cryptography-based project!This project combines multiple trending technologies, including Hybrid Cryptography, Multikey Cryptography, Video Communication, Real-time Streaming, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), AES Encryption, Client-Server Model, Socket Programming, Flask, SQLAlchemy, RSA, and Key Generation.Sounds interesting, right? Allow me to provide a brief introduction to this project.A Novel Hybrid Multikey Cryptography Technique for Video Communication with Client-Server ModelProtecting copyright and preventing piracy has become a crucial concern in real-time video streaming systems. This research project presents a revolutionary multi-key and hybrid cryptography approach to provide enhanced security for video communication.The project implements a software solution for video encryption and decryption using a continuous system based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) approach as pseudorandom encryption key generators. This approach generates multiple keys to encrypt and decrypt small chunks of video files dynamically, based on the video data. The implementation follows a client-server model utilizing socket programming.Video Walkthrough    Your browser does not support the video tagProject Flow      User Registeration    Here users input their email, password, MAC address, and import their public key on a Flask-developed web page. User data, including the public key, is securely stored in a SQLAlchemy database for future authentication and authorization.        User Login and Dashboard    Here Users login using their credentials, upon successful login, the dashboard displays video thumbnails, and provides a download button to obtain the client software for connecting to the streaming server.        Server Side Key Generation    The keys which are used to encrypt the video chunks are generated from the ECC equation.  First AES key is generated from the ECC equation which involves Video ID, remaining keys will be generated from the ECC equation which includes the previous key.        Video Encryption at Server Side    The encryption is done for the each video chunk individually. The 0th indexed chunk will be encrypted using the RSA with the receivers public key. The 1st indexed video chunk will be encrypted with the AES using the key generated from the ECC equation which involves VID, remaining chunks will be encrypted with AES and the keys generated from ECC equation which includes previously generated ECC key.        Sending Encrypted Video through Sockets    Encrypted video is transmitted over sockets using the client-server model. The video data is encrypted on the server side using a hybrid multikey cryptography technique and sent securely to the client for decryption, ensuring confidentiality during transmission.        Receiving Encrypted Video through Sockets    Encrypted video is received through sockets in the hybrid multikey cryptography technique. The server receives the encrypted video data, which is then decrypted using the shared session key, ensuring confidentiality and enabling playback or further processing of the video content.        Client Execution    During Client Execution, users run the client.py script on their local machine. The server requests the user to provide their email and password for verification. If the credentials entered match the ones used during registration, the server grants access and presents the user with a list of available videos.        Additional Authentication    In addition to the login credentials, users are prompted to enter their MAC address during authentication. This additional step helps to enhance security by verifying the user’s identity and ensuring that the device they are using is authorized for access.        Private Key Import    In order to decrypt a received video from the server, the user is prompted to provide the path to their private key. This private key is necessary to unlock the encryption applied to the video. By importing the private key, the user can authenticate themselves and gain access to the encrypted content, enabling them to view the video in its original form.        Key Generation at client    The keys will be generated in the same way they generated at the server side during the encryption.        Video Decryption and Playback:    The video will be decrypted if the private key and MAC address of the user is reasonable. Once decrypted, the video is rendered and displayed by a media player, allowing users to watch it without significant delays or interruptions. This encryption and playback process safeguards copyrighted material and maintains content security and integrity..  Encryption FlowThe video file encrypion flow as follows.1. Input video file Vinput2. Generate video chunks Vci from Vinput3. Fetch the receiver's public key of the RPkey4. Collect receiver's MAC address Rmac5. Generate VID using Vc06. Store VID in a temporary file7. Encrypt Vc0 using RSA8. Generate Keya ← x^3 + VID * x + Rmac9. Encrypt Vc1 using Keya and AES10. for i := 2 to n do11.    Generate Keya ← x^3 + Keya * x + Rmac12.    Encrypt Vci using Keya and AES13. end forInternal Processes:  User Registration:          During registration, users are required to import their public key, along with their email, password, and MAC address.        Encryption   The server-side encryption involves AES encryption of each 1MB chunk of the video file.}  Key generation:  The encryption key used for AES is generated using a novel key generation technique that combines RSA and ECC.  Decryption          The decryption was done at the client side same key generation was used here.      Analysis of ResultsTime to generate keysTo determine the impact of the multi-key in the encryption and decryption process, the time required to generate the key was calculated in this experiment. The method and equation used to derive the keys are the same for both encryption anddecryption. So, for the sake of analysis, the delay calculated for encryption has been employed in this part. The receiver’s public key and partial video data serve as the basis for the key used to encrypt the first video chunk. The remaining keys are obtained using the receiver’s MAC address, public key, and previously computed key. Since the length of the parameters is consistent during this procedure, the time between each key does not vary much.Time to encrypt video chunksThis section has talked about how long it takes to encrypt each chunk. Although the video processing modules split the video file into chunks for each full frame, the implementation assumes the chunk size to be 1 MB. The video chunks are fed into the AES module before being transmitted. The chunks are mostly the same in that it varies between 1MB and 1.2MB, and the time taken to encrypt each also varies between 0.9 sec to 1.2 sec.Number of keys generatedThe number of keys generated depends on the quantity of generated video chunks. This statistic has been considered for the study because the suggested solution uses multiple key technologies to provide improved security. Multiple keys have no impact on memory use because the keys are only momentarily saved at the transmitter and receiver sides. Furthermore, because each key is only utilized once, an increase in the number of keys has no impact on the fetching delay.Installing Entire Project      git clone https://github.com/th3m4r10/novel-cryptography-project.git        cd novel-cryptography-project        python3 -m venv env        source env/bin/activate        pip3 install -r requirements.txt  Now you are set to run this project      Move to Flask_App directory run the app.py        Visit your localhost to view the webpage on action        Register an account on the webpage        Start the server.py and run the client.py        Input the required data in the client.py console        Import your private to play the video  Keywords: Hybrid Cryptography, Multikey Cryptography, Video Communication, Real-time Streaming, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), AES Encryption, Client-Server Model, Socket Programming, Flask, SQLAlchemy, RSA, Key GenerationReferences  Project Guided By Sir, Kumar Anurupam  Research paper published by Sir.

The method and equation used to derive the keys are the same for both encryption anddecryption. So, for the sake of analysis, the delay calculated for encryption has been employed in this part. The receiver’s public key and partial video data serve as the basis for the key used to encrypt the first video chunk. The remaining keys are obtained using the receiver’s MAC address, public key, and previously computed key. Since the length of the parameters is consistent during this procedure, the time between each key does not vary much.</p><h3 id=\"time-to-encrypt-video-chunks\">Time to encrypt video chunks</h3><p>This section has talked about how long it takes to encrypt each chunk. Although the video processing modules split the video file into chunks for each full frame, the implementation assumes the chunk size to be 1 MB. The video chunks are fed into the AES module before being transmitted. The chunks are mostly the same in that it varies between 1MB and 1.2MB, and the time taken to encrypt each also varies between 0.9 sec to 1.2 sec.</p><h3 id=\"number-of-keys-generated\">Number of keys generated</h3><p>The number of keys generated depends on the quantity of generated video chunks. This statistic has been considered for the study because the suggested solution uses multiple key technologies to provide improved security. Multiple keys have no impact on memory use because the keys are only momentarily saved at the transmitter and receiver sides. Furthermore, because each key is only utilized once, an increase in the number of keys has no impact on the fetching delay.</p><h2 id=\"installing-entire-project\">Installing Entire Project</h2><ol>  <li>    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git clone https://github.com/th3m4r10/novel-cryptography-project.git</code></p>  </li>  <li>    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cd novel-cryptography-project</code></p>  </li>  <li>    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">python3 -m venv env</code></p>  </li>  <li>    <p>source env/bin/activate</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</p>  </li></ol><p>Now you are set to run this project</p><ul>  <li>    <p>Move to Flask_App directory run the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">app.py</code></p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Visit your localhost to view the webpage on action</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Register an account on the webpage</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Start the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">server.py</code> and run the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">client.py</code></p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Input the required data in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">client.py</code> console</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Import your private to play the video</p>  </li></ul><p><strong>Keywords</strong>: Hybrid Cryptography, Multikey Cryptography, Video Communication, Real-time Streaming, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), AES Encryption, Client-Server Model, Socket Programming, Flask, SQLAlchemy, RSA, Key Generation</p><h3 id=\"references\">References</h3><ul>  <li>Project Guided By <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumar-anurupam-a3464037/\">Sir, Kumar Anurupam</a></li>  <li>Research paper published by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkmundugar/\">Sir.

PicoCTF is a free online cybersecurity competition aimed at middle and high school students, but it’s also suitable for beginners of all ages. It was a great learning experience and I really learnt a lot.Let me explain the challenges that I have solved in picoCTF 2023.General Skills :I solved all the challenges that were given !ChronoHere is the given challenge :Firstly, We have to launch the instance and connect to the server with given credentials.Based on the question prompt it had to be cron jobs.After various attempts to access crontab itself, I tried looking inside /etc/crontab with the cat command.  Flag : picoCTF{Sch3DUL7NG_T45K3_L1NUX_1b4d8744}Money-wareHere is the given challenge :I don’t know what it is but i’m googling 1Mz7153HMuxXTuR2R1t78mGSdzaAtNbBWX, I got the link which had reports with descriptions and one of those descriptions points us to:More information is here :  https://blog.avira.com/petya-strikes-back/ This is an article about a vulnerability called Petya so our answer should be:  Flag : picoCTF{petya}PermissionsHere is the given challenge :We have to connect the server and cd / , I saw a directory named challenge, inside it there was a file which when cating it game the flag.  Flag : picoCTF{uS1ng_v1m_3dit0r_021d10ab}RepetitionsHere is the given challenge :The file itself looks like standard base64 encoding and decoding it will give you the flag use cyberchef.I had to decode with base64 six times to get the flag 😂  Flag : picoCTF{base64_n3st3d_dic0d!n8_d0wnl04d3d_dfe803c6}UselessHere is the given challenge :In the home directory there is a file named useless.After running the command man uselessWe got the flag,  Flag : picoCTF{us3l3ss_ch4ll3ng3_3xpl0it3d_3555}SpecialHere is the given challenge :This challenge was hard and to come with this bash script.My solution was as follows:cat flag.txt | cat /home/ctf-player/*/*.txt  Flag : picoCTF{5p311ch3ck_15_7h3_w0r57_a60bdf40}*** SpecialerHere is the given challenge :Connecting into the shell we’re not allowed a lot of things like cat, ls....After a lot of tries,My solution was as follows:echo \"$( &lt; /home/ctf-player/ala/kazam.txt)\"Now we got the flag :  Flag : picoCTF{5p311ch3ck_15_7h3_w0r57_a60bdf40}Cryptographhy :Although I couldn’t solve all the challenges, I managed to solve some of the challenges that I knew how to do!HideToSeeHere is the given challenge :Lets download the file.This is a jpeg file. We’ll be using a tool called steghide to extract information from this jpeg file, Use : steghide -sf --extract atbash.jpgHere we got a text file called encrypted.txt, Use : cat encrypted.txtkrxlXGU{zgyzhs_xizxp_8z0uvwwx}It looks like flag but it’s not.Now just need to decode atbash and you’re doneWe got the flag,  Flag : picoCTF{atbash_crack_6c4bcb08}ReadMyCertHere is the given challenge :Lets download the file.From the hint we were try to read the file. Bang !!And the flag is,  Flag : picoCTF{read_mycert_41d1c74c}RotationHere is the given challenge :Lets download the file and open with cat encrypted.txtxqkwKBN{z0bib1wv_l3kzgxb3l_555957n3}We got another encrypted text having the flag format. I got to know that this is a caesar cipher, so I used to decrypt with this online toolIt is a simple Rotation cipher, brute-forcing works fine.Here is the flag,  Flag : picoCTF{r0tat1on_d3crypt3d_949af1a1}Forensics :HidemeHere is the given challenge :Lets download the file and check file type with exiftool┌──[m4r10@parrot]─[/media/sf_CyberSec/task_files]└─$ file flag.png        flag.png: PNG image data, 512 x 504, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced                                                                                                                                                                        ┌──[m4r10@parrot]─[/media/sf_CyberSec/task_files]└─$ exiftool flag.png        ExifTool Version Number         : 12.57File Name                       : flag.pngDirectory                       : .File Size                       : 43 kBFile Modification Date/Time     : 2023:03:22 19:38:37+01:00File Access Date/Time           : 2023:03:22 19:38:53+01:00File Inode Change Date/Time     : 2023:03:22 19:38:48+01:00File Permissions                : -rw-r--r--File Type                       : PNGFile Type Extension             : pngMIME Type                       : image/pngImage Width                     : 512Image Height                    : 504Bit Depth                       : 8Color Type                      : RGB with AlphaCompression                     : Deflate/InflateFilter                          : AdaptiveInterlace                       : NoninterlacedWarning                         : [minor] Trailer data after PNG IEND chunkImage Size                      : 512x504Megapixels                      : 0.258This is a PNG, So we can observe the header using a tool called zsteg┌─[m4r10@parrot]─[/media/sf_CyberSec/task_files]└──╼ $zsteg flag.png [?] 3191 bytes of extra data after image end (IEND), offset = 0x9b3bextradata:0         .. file: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract    00000000: 50 4b 03 04 0a 00 00 00  00 00 3a 10 70 56 00 00  |PK........:.pV..|    00000010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 07 00 1c 00 73 65  |..............se|    00000020: 63 72 65 74 2f 55 54 09  00 03 8f 78 12 64 8f 78  |cret/UT....x.d.x|    00000030: 12 64 75 78 0b 00 01 04  00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00  |.dux............|    00000040: 00 50 4b 03 04 14 00 00  00 08 00 3a 10 70 56 67  |.PK........:.pVg|    00000050: 45 23 b5 35 0b 00 00 d0  0b 00 00 0f 00 1c 00 73  |E#.5...........s|    00000060: 65 63 72 65 74 2f 66 6c  61 67 2e 70 6e 67 55 54  |ecret/flag.pngUT|    00000070: 09 00 03 8f 78 12 64 8f  78 12 64 75 78 0b 00 01  |....x.d.x.dux...|    00000080: 04 00 00 00 00 04 00 00  00 00 cd 56 59 3c 14 fc  |...........VY&lt;..|    00000090: 1a fe 87 b2 26 1f 22 5b  a3 65 1a 59 c6 30 76 33  |....&amp;.\"[.e.Y.0v3|    000000a0: c4 47 92 35 44 f6 35 bb  6c 43 1a 65 64 49 85 10  |.G.5D.5.lC.edI..|    000000b0: 45 d9 3e 6a ec 63 9d 21  64 df 69 08 23 fb 12 45  |E.&gt;j.c.!d.i.#..E|    000000c0: f6 65 2c 8d 8a 33 e7 77  ae ce c5 b9 3f ef c5 fb  |.e,..3.w....?...|    000000d0: bc db 73 f7 fe 9e df f3  cc d8 50 e7 34 9b 20 1b  |..s.......P.4. .|    000000e0: 00 e0 b4 ee 0d 2d 13 00  18 ee d0 6b 59 2e 7a 02  |.....-.....kY.z.|    000000f0: 7b 3e 57 cc e9 c0 e4 a6  61 a0 01 40 45 02 fb 6f  |{&gt;W.....a..@E..o|Interesting 😎.
