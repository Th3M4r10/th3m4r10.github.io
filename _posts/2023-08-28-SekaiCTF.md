Hello all!<br>
I have recently played <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1923"> SekaiCTF 2023</a>. <br>
Which was happened from Fri, 25 Aug. 2023, 21:30 IST to Sun, 27 Aug. 2023, 21:30 IST.<br>

Here is the challenge from the category of <a style="color:cyan">Professional Programming & Coding (PPC)</a>

Time limit is 5 seconds. There is rate limiting and you can only submit once every 30 seconds. For simplicity, sample input `1.in` is given in this challenge.

#### Problem Statement

![six degrees of wikipedia ](/assets/img/post_img/sekai_wiki_game.png)

The `Wiki Game` is a hypertextual game designed to work speciﬁcally with Wikipedia. Player starts on some randomly selected article, and must navigate to another pre-selected target article solely by clicking links within each article. The goal is to arriveat the target article in the fewest clicks. According to `Six degrees of Wikipedia`, you can almost always complete the game in 6 clicks.

The Wikipedia database can be modelled as an unweighted, directed graph where each article corresponds to a vertex. It is important to note that the graph can contain cycles. Your goal is to efﬁciently determine whether it is possible to navigate from the source article to the target article within a maximum path length of 6.

#### Input

The ﬁrst line of input contains an integer `T (1 ≤ T ≤ 20)`, the number of test cases. In each test case, the ﬁrst line contains two space-separated integers `n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1,000)` and <br>`m (1 ≤ m ≤ 4,000)`,the number of vertices and edges respectively. The next m lines describe the graph. The ith line contains two space-separated integers `ui, vi (0 ≤ ui ≠ vi< n)`, meaning there exists a path from **_ui_** to **_vi_** . The last line contains two space-separated integers `src, dst (0 ≤ src ≠ dst < n)`, the source and target vertices.

### Output
Output should have T lines. Each line prints YES if there exists a path from **_`src`_** to **_`dst`_** within a path length of 6, or NO otherwise. Remember to print them in upper-case.

### Explanation
In the ﬁrst test case, there exists a path `0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6` of length 6, so the answer is `YES`.
In the second test case, there is no path from 0 to 9 so the answer is NO. There is a path of length 3 from 9 to 0, but the graph is directed so it does not count.


To meet the time limit of 5 seconds and optimize the solution further, I used a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find a path within a maximum of 6 steps. I thought BFS is a better choice for this scenario as it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we can find the shortest path first. <br>

Here's the Python code using BFS:

`CODE:`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def is_possible_to_reach(graph, src, dst):
    visited = [False] * len(graph)
    queue = [(src, 0)]

    while queue:
        node, depth = queue.pop(0)
        if node == dst:
            return True

        if depth >= 6:
            continue

        visited[node] = True

        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                queue.append((neighbor, depth + 1))

    return False

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]

        for _ in range(m):
            u, v = map(int, input().split())
            graph[u].append(v)

        src, dst = map(int, input().split())

        if is_possible_to_reach(graph, src, dst):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

__This code should provide a faster solution using BFS, which is well-suited for finding paths in graphs. It will also handle the given time limit and rate limiting constraints more effectively.__

Finally I got the flag,
